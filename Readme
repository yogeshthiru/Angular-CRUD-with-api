Hi there,
to run this app, navigate to your application path in cmd then install npm packages using 

    npm install

then install bootstrap by

    npm install bootstrap --save 

this will include the latest version of bootstrap into your file
then create a json server using the commands

    npm i -g json-server

now you can start the json server using the command
    json-server --watch filename.json or json-server --watch db.json

after this command paste your json data in the db.json then again run the above command
now you can see your api is live in localhost 3000 in most of the cases,

then install the following packages for searching, sorting and pagination

    npm i ng2-search-filter
    npm i ng2-order-pipe
    npm i ngx-pagination

I hope this will help you .
